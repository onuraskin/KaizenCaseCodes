# Getting Started
This project is my first project using TypeScript, and I have never realized a project using TypeScript before. Until this time, I have only realized React Native projects with JavaScript. If I provide information about the case, the data provided from the endpoints felt a bit incomplete. Nevertheless, I used all the endpoints in the PDF. Since the last service in the PDF did not return the answer to the two parameters requested, I only request to this service with an ID. I could not find the description on the detail page in the returned JSON. The steps in the PDF were short and lacked detail. It was a very good experience for me. I hope that if I have mistakes, I can correct them with the help of your experience.  Thank you! 
Best Regards .
#  Cloning the Repository and Installing Dependencies
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
 #For ios 
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
#For Android
yarn install
```

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```
